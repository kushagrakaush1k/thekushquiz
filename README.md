Day 1 of Building 15+ cool Front-end projects and posting them daily!

To kick things off, I built a fun quiz all about me, Kushagra Kaushik, using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For the next 15 days, I'll be building and shipping a new project every single day to sharpen my frontend skills. Once this challenge is complete, I'm diving headfirst into backend projects.
